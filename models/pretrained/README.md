This model was trained on the VDJdb dataset ([August 2019 release](https://github.com/antigenomics/vdjdb-db/releases/tag/2019-08-08)) that was filtered on human TRB data, no 10x data and restricted to 10-20 (CDR3) or 8-11 (epitope) amino acid residues, with negatives that were generated by shuffling (i.e. sampling an negative epitope for each positive CDR3 sequence), and downsampling the most abundant epitopes down to 400 pairs each.
