# the oneliner will attempt to move up two directories from the location of this script and set that as the project root.
# A potential problem with this approach is that when PROJECT_ROOT is not a resolved path, RAW_DATA_PATH will not be valid.
# However, normally this script will either be used on its own (and PROJECT_ROOT will be empty initially)
# or it will be invoked by the Makefile, which should pass a fully resolved path.
# To be safe, the PROJECT_ROOT variable is assigned a second time as resolved path.
# Note that "readlink -f/--canonicalize" or "realpath" are not used because it does not exist on all systems.
